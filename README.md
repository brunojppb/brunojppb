I am a passionate Software Engineer who loves crafting solutions that can help ease our lives and make it more fun. Originally from Brazil, currently based in Vienna, Austria.  
  
I am mainly interested in Web development and programming languages these days. I have been writing web applications using Scala, Elixir, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I also think React is cool.
